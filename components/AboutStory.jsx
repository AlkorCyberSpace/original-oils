          <p>
            Our main products are gingelly oil and coconut oil. We make gingelly
            oil using carefully selected, good-quality gingelly seeds. It is
            prepared in the traditional way by adding palm jaggery. We have more
            than 50 years of experience in making coconut oil using traditional
            methods.
          </p>

          <p>
            We always use the finest quality seeds because they are healthier and
            better. Our bottles may look different in shape or size, but the
            quality of the oil is always the same.
          </p>

          <p>
            Traditional Artisan’s Originals started in 1960. Honesty and trust
